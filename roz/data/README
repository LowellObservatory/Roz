The static portions of the LMI Filter Information Table are contained in two
forms:
  * ECSV Format: The table information and section heads are contained in
                 separate files:
        - ``lmi_filter_table.ecsv``
        - ``lmi_table_sechead.ecsv``
   * XML Format: Both portions of the above table are also contained in a
                 single VO-Table XML file:
        - lmi_filter_table.xml

If the LMI filter complement changes, both versions of the static table need
to be updated.  The dynamic table (stored in the un-tracked
lmi_dynamic_filter.ecsv) will follow any changes in the static table.  This
tracking is performed in the function
``roz.lmi_confluence_table.modify_lmi_dynamic_table()``.

The file ``lmi_filter_table.css`` contains style-sheet information for
inclusion with the HTML table prior to posting to Confluence.
