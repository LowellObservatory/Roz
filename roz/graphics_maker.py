"""Make graphs desired for inclusion on the Confluence page

This module is part of the Roz package, written at Lowell Observatory.

This module will eventually create graphs for investigative purposes and/or
for upload to Confluence.  Alternatively, what could be produced here could
also be produced by the Grafana interface with the InfluxDB database that will
house the actual data from Roz.

This module primarily trades in... hope?
